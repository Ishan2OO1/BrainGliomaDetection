# Brain Glioma Detection using Logistic Regression
## Overview
Gliomas are a type of brain tumor classified into low-grade gliomas (TCGA-LGG) and glioblastomas (TCGA-GBM), which vary significantly in severity and treatment approaches. This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict the presence and type of glioma using the Glioma Grading Dataset.

The model aims to assist in glioma classification, contributing to medical research and facilitating early detection and effective treatment planning.

### Dataset
Source: Glioma Grading Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/759/glioma+grading+clinical+and+mutation+features+dataset

Classes:
* TCGA-LGG (Low-Grade Glioma)
* TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma)
  
Features: Includes various clinical and genetic markers relevant to glioma grading.
### Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a logistic regression model that:

* Classifies glioma into TCGA-LGG or TCGA-GBM.

This solution enables medical professionals and researchers to leverage data-driven predictions for faster and more accurate diagnosis.
